              His paintings, drawings, and graphic works reveal fractures of a
              world that seems suspended in-between time and space. The major
              themes populating this tenebrous and sometimes surreal
              “counter-reality” tackle the relation between memory, matter,
              innocence and error.

              >“A scene manifold, theatrical. Black boxes are illuminated to
              allow you see the unsuspected mental machinery within, a column
              that penetrates the floor towards something you can't yet make
              out, closets that open and absorb you into a world of which you
              are suspicious, but there are no means of closing them. Andrei
              Gamarț's exhibition Mirror for The Full Moon places you in front
              of your own character, a character hitherto unknown.” (Excerpt
              from Răzvan Ion - "Mirror for The Full Moon")

              “What makes me negotiate about the end of painting when I try to
              interpret the paintings of Gamarț is their force of mirroring
              various stages of the history of painting, of challenging our
              cultural memory as well as their surrealist content reflecting our
              ambiguous notions and understanding of the world we live in. These
              paintings with their content and references may indicate end of
              history, but with their re-configured aesthetics they re-generate
              a new experience for painted images.” (Excerpt from Beral Madra -
              “Negotiate about the end of painting”)

              “When I reflect upon it, I can see that it's a journey full of
              twists and turns. To where exactly is yet to be seen. I take great
              care in the process; each step is investigated in detail. I
              observe phenomena from a remove; taking note of objects, images
              and words that can seem trivial but may trigger the attention -
              such as how the light falls upon a surface, and how firstly
              flowers appear upon trees and then there are only the leaves, then
              the seemingly lifeless body. “ (Excerpt from Andrei Gamarț -
              “Short introduction: a direction”)
